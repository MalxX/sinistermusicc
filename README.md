This is a place for me to store code that our music club bot uses, polls + threads archives, etc. It's a lot easier than using Google Docs or Pastebin etc because I can add multiple documents and have them be publicly available. If I relaunch the bot then this will be the repo I do it from.
# General Reading Guide
## Below this doc you'll find various ".md"s, which will be text based thread + poll archives. The pinned section on the [sinistermusicc account](https://twitter.com/sinistermusicc) will still remain the main archive, but this one will be more comprehensive and easy to follow (hopefully). 
## This README.md file will be updated when club info is updated. Please refer to the commits to review any changes.

# Structure
**As mentioned previously, this repository acts as an archive.**

Album submissions are to be sumitted underneath the "pinned" section on the [sinistermusicc twitter account.](https://twitter.com/sinistermusicc) There will be a weekly thread for this. **Please only submit one album per person to ensure everyone gets an equal chance to have their album drawn.**

Once albums have been submitted (again, one per person on a weekly basis), they will be promptly uploaded to the "masterlist" here on Github. The masterlist will have the album submissions organized via the week they were submitted. **Any albums that are older than two weeks will be removed to keep the list fresh. You may resubmit your album again if it's still there and wasn't chosen previously.**
