## This is a place for me to store code that our music club bot uses, polls + threads archives, etc. It's a lot easier than using Google Docs or Pastebin etc because I can add multiple documents and have them be publicly available. If I relaunch the bot then this will be the repo I do it from.
## Below this doc you'll find various ".md"s, which will be text based thread + poll archives. The pinned section on the sinistermusicc account will also be an archive.
##### Additonally, you'll be able to find the "masterlist" which will contain the albums that are currently in the club's rotation. Albums that are submitted via the weekly threads will be listed here as a point of reference. Keep in mind that these albums will be rotated out **every two weeks** to ensure that the list remains fresh and up-to-date. Feel free to resubmit your album again once it's "expired". Weekly album winners will choose the album that the club listens to for next week. As of now albums won't be chosen through polling to ensure that all albums get a fair shot, but this is subject to change.
