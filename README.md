## This is a place for me to store code that our music club bot uses, polls + threads archives, etc. It's a lot easier than using Google Docs or Pastebin etc because I can add multiple documents and have them be publicly available. If I relaunch the bot then this will be the repo I do it from.
# General Reading Guide
## Below this doc you'll find various ".md"s, which will be text based thread + poll archives. The pinned section on the [sinistermusicc account](https://twitter.com/sinistermusicc) will still remain the main archive, but this one will be more comprehensive and easy to follow (hopefully). 
## **Think of this as a great reference point if you are ever in charge of selecting the latest album for listening.
## Additonally, you'll be able to find the "masterlist" which will contain the albums that are currently in the club's rotation. Albums that are submitted via the weekly threads will be listed here as a point of reference. Keep in mind that these albums will be rotated out **every two weeks** to ensure that the list remains fresh and up-to-date. Feel free to resubmit your album again once it's "expired". Weekly album winners will choose the album that the club listens to for next week. *As of now albums won't be chosen through polling to ensure that all albums get a fair shot, but this is subject to change.* 
## This README.md file will be updated when club info is updated. Please refer to the commits to review any changes.
