# sinistermusicc
This is a place for me to store code and information our music club uses, polls + threads archives, etc. It's a lot easier than using Google Docs or Pastebin etc because I can add multiple documents and have them be publicly available. If I relaunch the bot then this will be the repo I do it from.
## General Reading Guide
-> In this repository you'll find various ".md"s, which will be text based thread + poll archives. The pinned section on the [sinistermusicc account](https://twitter.com/sinistermusicc) will still remain the main archive, but this one will be more comprehensive and easy to follow (hopefully). 

-> This README.md file will be updated when club info is updated. Please refer to the commits to review any changes.

## Structure
**As mentioned previously, this repository acts as an archive.**

Album submissions are to be sumitted underneath the "pinned" section on the music club twitter account. There will be a [weekly thread](https://twitter.com/sinistermusicc/status/1503904531054268416?s=20&t=42AgeZexYdC5sKRR2X-dKA) for this. **Please only submit one album per person to ensure everyone gets an equal chance to have their album drawn.**

Once albums have been submitted (again, one per person on a weekly basis), they will be promptly uploaded to the [masterlist](/masterlist.md/) here on Github. The masterlist will have the album submissions organized via the week they were submitted. **Any albums that are older than two weeks will be removed to keep the list fresh. You may resubmit your album again if it's still there and wasn't chosen previously.** Albums listed as active (~~albums will look like this if inactive~~) will be chosen for the weekly draw at random using a [randomizer wheel](https://pickerwheel.com/). I will manually announce the results when the album is chosen. (Prior winners will be *italicized and will have a strikethrough like ~~this~~ for easy reference*). This isn't my ideal approach because I want this specifically to be community-led but it will have to do until we get a newer system put in place-or until we find a better workaround.

That's pretty much all the core info for now! Again this doc will be updated (as shown through the commits) as information gets updated, fixed, or polished. Major updates will be announced through the twitter account so you don't miss anything!

Please utilize this repository as much as you like and, if you want, use the Discussion feature! It can be utilized to post longer reviews, thoughts, and opinions which you can then link to twitter if you feel so inclined.

Thanks for being here, and happy listening!
